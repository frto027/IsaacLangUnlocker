Hey, you finally found this project.

This sloppy project can be used to enable isaac's localization feature, which was disabled in the rep+ beta test.

This is developed for the unofficial Chinese translation patch. But other languages still can be configured with a `fixlang.ini` file.

Feel free to contact me via issue or some other ways if you are intrested with this.
